# Overview
This project implements a machine learning solution for the Kaggle Social Media Extremism Detection Challenge. We built a baseline model to classify social media posts as EXTREMIST or NON_EXTREMIST, conducted thorough qualitative analysis through team annotation, and performed systematic error analysis to identify improvement opportunities.
